# Justin Javascript Password Generator 
This password generator was created using javascript with previously written starter code obtained from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet.
The generator should allow for creations of passwords between 8 and 128 characters while allowing the user to choose to include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters (at least one categories of these must be chosen).

## Installation
Download the code and run index.html found in the Develop folder with a web browser. 
This code was tested in Google Chrome.

Alternatively it can be found here: https://justincode98.github.io/Justin-Javascript-Password-Generator/.

## Usage
After running index.html, clicking on the "Generate Password" button should launch a series of prompts.
Answering the prompts generates a password that conforms to the answers given in the prompts.
